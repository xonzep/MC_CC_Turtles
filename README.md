These are LUA files for my work on programming Turtles in Minecraft-ComputerCraft. The code is messy
with lots of comments and rambling code. FarmerGoBrr is probably the only thing that works mostly right
but it doesn't place water correctly. But there are a couple functions there that are interesting and may be of use in other turtle programs.
